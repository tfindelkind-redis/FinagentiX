# Note: This project uses staged deployment with custom scripts
# Run: ./infra/scripts/deploy.sh (or azd up which calls the script)
# 
# Why custom scripts?
# - Sequential stage deployment required (Foundation -> Data -> AI -> Apps)
# - Stage outputs must feed into next stage (VNet IDs, subnet IDs, etc.)
# - Some stages take 20+ minutes (Redis), parallel deployment not suitable

# Hooks for custom deployment steps
hooks:
  preprovision:
    posix:
      shell: sh
      run: ./infra/scripts/deploy.sh
    windows:
      shell: pwsh
      run: .\infra\scripts\deploy.ps1
